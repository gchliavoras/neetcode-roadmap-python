# Neetcode Roadmap in Python

This repository contains my solutions to [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io)'s algorithms roadmap, implemented in Python.

---

## Structure

The problems are organized into folders by category:

- `01_Arrays_and_Hashing`
- `02_Two_Pointers`
- `03_Stack`
- `04_Binary_Search`
- `05_Sliding_Window`
- `06_Linked_List`  
*(and more as I continue the roadmap)*

## Next Steps

- [x] Reorganize files into subdirectories  
- [x] Add `.gitignore`  
- [ ] Clean up solution files and ensure consistency  
- [ ] Add informative docstrings and comments to each solution  
- [ ] Continue progressing through the Neetcode roadmap
